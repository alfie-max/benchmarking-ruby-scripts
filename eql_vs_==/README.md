## Inference
`==` is marginally faster than `eql`, combined with slower process could be a problem

## Output

### ==

```sh
       user     system      total        real
   0.290000   0.010000   0.300000 (  0.288342)
```

### eql

```sh
       user     system      total        real
   0.280000   0.000000   0.280000 (  0.281650)
```
